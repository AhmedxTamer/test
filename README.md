## Overview

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data science workflow. This project aims to simplify and automate common data preprocessing tasks to help users clean, transform, and normalize their data efficiently.

The repository contains modules for:
- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Data splitting
- Outlier detection
- Data transformation

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Normalization & Scaling:** Standardize data using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standardization.
- **Feature Encoding:** Convert categorical variables into numeric forms using methods like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
- **Data Splitting:** Split datasets into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identify and remove outliers from your dataset using statistical methods.

## Installation
